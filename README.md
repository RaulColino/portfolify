Customizable blog with built-in CMS that you only host in one place.

## Features

### Lighting fast.

Portfolify is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using SSG for deployments so it's blazingly fast.


### Streamlined writing experience: 
Forget about writing markdown files and uploading them to your server via terminal. With portfolify, you can write your blog posts in a simple, efficient and intuitive interface and publish them in seconds without leaving the WYSIWYG editor.

### Cost Efective: 
It is a static site, so you can host it for free on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Amazon S3, or any other static site host.
